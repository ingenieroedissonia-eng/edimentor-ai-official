# 🤖 EdiMentor AI — Flagship Product (M.A.I.I.E. Ecosystem)

**EdiMentor AI** is an enterprise-grade artificial intelligence platform designed under the **Edisson Intelligent Architecture & Engineering Model (M.A.I.I.E.)**.  
It operates as a **CTO-level strategic copilot and technical mentor**, capable of reasoning, responding, and assisting in real time with engineering and business challenges.

The system is built with **real production standards**, not as an experimental demo.

## 🎯 The Problem

There is a lack of 24/7 AI systems that truly demonstrate:

- Real production architecture  
- Structured reasoning  
- Proper use of enterprise cloud services  
- A clear path toward advanced agent orchestration  

Most solutions remain simple chat interfaces without architectural rigor.

---

## 💡 The Solution

EdiMentor AI implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture with guided reasoning and specialized roles, enabling:

- Context-aware and technical responses  
- Real-time strategic mentorship  
- A solid foundation for evolution toward **multi-agent orchestration**  

The system does not just chat — **it reasons, guides, and structures decisions** within a unified ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Core Engine:** Google Vertex AI — **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- **AI Architecture:** RAG with controlled grounding
- **Orchestration:** Specialized role logic (Architect, Engineer, Auditor),  
  designed and ready for future **LangChain & LangGraph** integration
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel (CI/CD & production deployment)
- **Persistence:** Deterministic JSON-based memory (MVP),  
  architected for future Vector Store integration
- **Security:** Google Cloud Service Account authentication via Base64 environment variables

## 🚀 Key Technical Achievements

- **Stable Cloud Connectivity**  
  Verified production-grade integration between Vercel and Google Vertex AI.

- **Grounding Engine v6.0**  
  Advanced use of `systemInstruction` following official Vertex AI SDK specifications, ensuring aligned and controlled responses.

- **Deterministic Tool-Calling**  
  Structured JSON outputs designed for future API integrations and automated workflows.

- **Logical Role Routing**  
  Controlled routing of queries to specialized roles (Architect, Engineer, Auditor).

- **Multi-Device Stability**  
  Mobile-first and desktop-stable chat UI using `h-[100dvh]` for consistent UX.

- **Scalable Architecture Foundation**  
  Production-ready base prepared for multi-agent workflows and vector memory.
